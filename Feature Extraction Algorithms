Image Feature extraction algorithms, each suitable for different tasks:

1- Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): Ideal for object detection in images,
particularly useful in computer vision tasks such as pedestrian detection.

2- Local Binary Patterns (LBP): Effective for texture classification and recognition.

3- Corner Detection (e.g., Harris Corner Detection): Great for detecting corners
or interest points in an image, commonly used in feature-based image registration and matching.

4- Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT): Provides robust feature extraction
that is invariant to scale, rotation, and illumination changes, but it's computationally 
expensive and may have licensing issues.

5- Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF): Similar to SIFT but faster due to its 
integral image-based approach. Like SIFT, it's also invariant to scale, 
rotation, and illumination changes.

6- Edge Detection (e.g., Canny Edge Detector): Useful for finding edges 
in images, which can be fundamental for further processing tasks like 
object detection or segmentation.

7- Blob Detection (e.g., Difference of Gaussians): Suitable for detecting
regions in an image that differ in properties such as brightness or color.
